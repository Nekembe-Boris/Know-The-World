# KNOW THE WORLD!

When was the last time you really tested yourself on the number of countries you know across all continents?

The inspiration to carry this project came after completing [Day25](https://github.com/Nekembe-Boris/100-Days-of-Code-Projects/tree/main/Day25) of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu. It is an interactive game built using Python (Turtle module) and pandas.
